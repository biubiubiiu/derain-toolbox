## Motivation

The idea of creating this project strikes me when I was trying to reproduce someone else's work. I spent the entire afternoon setting up the environment (cause they used a prehistoric setup) and reading and debugging their code (a complete piece of shit). Isn't it a complete waste of life to do any more of this shit?

Some great works like [detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2), [mmediting](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmediting) and [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) have shown the elegance of unified framework, which brings standard pipilines and human-readable code. So I tried building mmderain and reimplementing previous deraining algorithms, although it's just a clumsy imitation.
